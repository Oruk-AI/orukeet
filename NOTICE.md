# Attribution and license scope

Orukeet is an adaptation of **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3**. NVIDIA retains
copyright in its model and upstream work. The base weights are distributed
under [CC BY 4.0](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3).
Oruk AI's changes comprise multilingual/accent continuation training, parameter
blending, fitted and frozen Gabor-kernel replacement and recovery, native and ONNX
export, application integration and evaluation. [Model stages](https://github.com/Oruk-AI/orukeet/blob/main/release/model-stages.json)
identifies r3 as the source of every current Orukeet download and records its ancestry.

The r3 NeMo, ONNX INT8, Q8 GGUF and F16 GGUF weights, and their fitted Gabor kernels,
are designated **CC BY-SA 4.0**.
The complete license is in [LICENSE-WEIGHTS](LICENSE-WEIGHTS). This permits
commercial use and modification, with attribution and applicable ShareAlike
requirements. Earlier checkpoints retain their source notices and are not
silently relicensed by this file. Orukeet v0.1.0 distributes the final r3 checkpoint in all four formats.

Python and integration code in this repository is MIT unless a file specifies
otherwise. The native bindings, audio windowing and worker transport derive
from OpenWhisper by Knuckles92 and its Oruk AI integration; their MIT notice is
retained in [LICENSE](LICENSE). The downloaded NVIDIA NeMo-Speech.cpp SDK and
its bundled dependencies retain their own notices, including Apache-2.0 and
MIT components. Keep the SDK's license files when redistributing it. The
[pinned source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Speech.cpp/tree/4f9676226f667d14608487df744f375db87127f8)
is the authority for those terms.

The optional [Metal source build](runtime/README.md) includes ggml
kernel and NeMo attention/cache patches, with pinned sources and attribution
in `runtime/`. Those patches retain the source projects' MIT and Apache-2.0
terms; they are separate from the fitted Gabor model weights.

The ONNX exporter follows sherpa-onnx's Parakeet TDT v3 conversion script.
Its upstream reference and Apache-2.0 license are retained in
[export/onnx](export/onnx/README.md). The ONNX archive includes the weight
license and source attribution. The optimized ONNX encoder evaluates 24
quantized depthwise convolutions with exactly equivalent FP32 arithmetic using
standard runtime operators. This changes execution without retraining or
changing the quantized values. Original export and separate optimization
receipts are retained in `evidence/onnx-r3-20260910/` and
`evidence/speed20260910/`.

Data were filtered, split, normalized and sampled as described in

The generated statistical records in `evidence/metric-evidence.tar.gz`, the
Gabor recovery count bundles under `training/gabor_half/results/`, and the
FT-4035 benchmark counts under `evidence/regression-ft-20260907/` are
designated CC BY 4.0, attributed to Oruk AI. This designation covers the
prepared metric records; it does not relicense the original corpus recordings
or transcripts, which are not included in that archive.

The r3 numeric benchmark records in `evidence/standard-asr-r3-20260908/` and
`evidence/domains-r3-20260908/` are released under CC BY 4.0. They contain
error counts and recording identifiers; dataset audio remains with its providers.

The paired ONNX application benchmark counts in `evidence/onnx-r3-20260910/`
are also released under CC BY 4.0. These records contain numeric errors,
timings and recording identifiers, without corpus audio or transcripts.
