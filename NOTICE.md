The generated statistical records in `evidence/metric-evidence.tar.gz`, the
Gabor recovery count bundles under `training/gabor_half/results/`, and the
FT-4035 benchmark counts under `evidence/regression-ft-20260907/` are
designated CC BY 4.0, attributed to Oruk AI. This designation covers the
prepared metric records; it does not relicense the original corpus recordings
or transcripts, which are not included in that archive.

The r3 numeric benchmark records in `evidence/standard-asr-r3-20260908/` and
`evidence/domains-r3-20260908/` are released under CC BY 4.0. They contain
